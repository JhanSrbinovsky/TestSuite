! CCONSTS start
! Description:
!    This file contains declarations for derived constants within
!   the atmospheric model. Where necessary PARAMETERS are defined to
!   dimension these constants. All constants are placed in the common
!   block CDERIVED, except hardwired constants, e.g. ETA_SPLIT and LENs.
!   file CMAXSIZE must be included first
!
!   The derived constants are calculated in the routine SETCONA1.

!   4.0   20/07/95  Sizes of tables expanded for version 3A
!                   of the radiation in sections 1 and 2. J.M. Edwards
!   5.0   21/06/99  Remove obsolete constants, for C-P C-grid dynamics.

!   5.1   25/02/00  Replace Data ETA_SPLIT by hard-wire h_split in
