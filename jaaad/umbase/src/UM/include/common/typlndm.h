! TYPLNDM
! Formerly integral part of TYPCONA, the variables below have been
! separated from the rest of TYPCONA as they are required by some
! of the Ocean routines in the Ocean-Atmosphere configuration of
! the UM whilest TYPCONA is not.

      ! Primary Arrays
      INTEGER::land_points     ! No. of land points  (can be 0)
      INTEGER::land_ice_points ! Number of land ice points
      INTEGER::soil_points     ! Number of soil points

!     INTEGER::land_index (land_field) ! set from land_sea_mask
!     INTEGER::land_ice_index (land_field)  ! Array of land ice points.
!     INTEGER::soil_index(land_field)       ! Array of soil points.
! sza fix conflict case when land_field=0
      INTEGER::land_index (max(1,land_field)) ! set from land_sea_mask
      INTEGER::land_ice_index (max(1,land_field))  ! Array of land ice points.
      INTEGER::soil_index(max(1,land_field))       ! Array of soil points.

      ! Gets some sizes transported around the model :
      COMMON /land_soil_dimensions/                                     &
     &  land_points , land_ice_points , soil_points
