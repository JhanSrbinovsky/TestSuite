! TYPD1 needs access to N_SUBMODEL_PARTITION/_MAX in CSUBMODL. However,
! they are not always called in the same decks and in the right order.
! Therefore, copy the values to another file and include it from TYPD1

      INTEGER ALT_N_SUBMODEL_PARTITION

      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: ALT_N_SUBMODEL_PARTITION_MAX=4

      COMMON/CALTSUBM/ALT_N_SUBMODEL_PARTITION
! CALTSUBM end
