!LL   SUBROUTINE COEX,COEX2,CMPS,XPND,INSTIN,EXTRIN -----------------
!LL
!LL   PURPOSE:   PACK TO AND UNPACK FROM WGDOS FORMAT
!LL
!LL   (Note that for optimal performance the routines INSTIN and
!LL    EXTRIN are inline expanded (enable option 8 on fpp)
!LL
!LL  Model            Modification history from model version 3.0:
!LL version  Date
!LL   3.2  19/04/93  Code for ne real missing data indicator (TCJ).
!LL   4.2  Nov. 96   T3E migration: WHENNE,WHENEQ replaced by
!LL                   portable fortran code.   S.J.Swarbrick
!LL   4.3  Apr. 97 T3E migration: Calling the functions CRI2IBM/IBM2CRI
!LL                directly replaces the calls to the (now unsupported)
!LL                routines USICTI, USICTC, USSCTC, USSCTI. Ian Edmond
!LL   5.0 05/03/99 Remove DEF,C98_1A. D. Robinson.
!LL   5.1  23/03/00 Add declaration for CRI2IBM. S.D.Mullerworth
!LL   5.2  15/11/00 Allow use in reconfiguration. P.Selwood.
!LL
!LL   5.1 May. 00  The max number of bits per value used in the wgdos
!LL                packed data is 31. This implies that the maximum
!LL                difference from the base value which can be stored
!LL                is 2.147483E+09. A check is now added to prevent
!LL                values greater than this being stored.  Ian Edmond
!LL   5.3  07/06/01 Declare cri2ibm.  A van der Wal
!     5.5  14/02/03 Add Implicit None + appropriate declarations where
!                   necessary. Tidy up some declarations. T.White
!LL   5.5  28/02/03 Insert code for portable data conversion routines
!LL                 to replace Cray-specific CRI2IBM etc.     P.Dando
!     6.0  10/09/03 Conversion of portable data conversion routines
!                   (IEEE2IBM etc) into functions with error return
!                   codes matching those of CRAY routines.   P.Dando
!     6.0  25/09/03 Optimisation for NEC.
!                   Bob Carruthers, Gerrit v.d. Velde, Paul Selwood.
!     6.1  23/08/04 Add FLDCALC def. D Robinson
!     6.1  13/09/04 Fix bug with insertion of zero and missing data
!                   bit maps (filling to end of next 32-bit word)
!                   in CMPS routine when row_length is a multiple of
!                   64.                                    P.Dando
!     6.2  26/10/05 Added function ishift which behaves in a standard
!                   way (as expected by coex) to fix WGDOS errors in
!                   ifc compiled runs.                     T. Edwards
!     6.2  24/11/05 Optimisation for NEC. Two new subroutines added -
!                   CMPS_ALL and XPND_ALL. J-C.Rioual(NEC)/D.Robinson.

!     This is a portable replacement for ishft, which behaves as the UM
!     expects it too when shifting more than 64 bits.


      function ishift(num, shift)
      implicit none
        integer num, shift
        integer ishift
        if(abs(shift) >= kind(num)*8) then
          ishift = 0
        else
          ishift = ishft(num, shift)
        end if
