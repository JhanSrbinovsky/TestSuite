! PARAMETERs defining the RIM_TYPE characteristics

!  History:
!  Date      Vn     Modification
!  31/10/01  5.3    Reset Nrima_max to 1. Change rima_type_orog
!                   from 2 to 1. D. Robinson

      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: Nrima_max = 1

      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: rima_type_norm=1  ! Normal field
      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: rima_type_orog=1  ! Orography field

! At 5.3 rima_type_orog=2 => rima_type_orog=1. This means that
! Orography LBCs has the same rim type as all prognostic LBCs. The
! value was changed rather than remove all occurences from the code to
! retain the functionality if it ever needs to be restored and to
! simplify the number of changes required.
